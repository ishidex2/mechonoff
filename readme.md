Unchanged version of MechOnOff

Yes, I know the code is terrible, but it's a gamejam entry, so I had to compromise maintainability in favor of productivity. Of course, over the entire development I had to factor some things out to make it bearable, but in the end the code just works, yes, it's bug prone, but code isn't static and I'm sure it's very easy to just make it more maintainable.

correctness -> maintainability -> performance

to compile on linux, install `SDL_Mixer` and run `make run` in the root directory
